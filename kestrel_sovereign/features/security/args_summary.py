"""Shared masking + summarization for security audit ``args_summary`` values.

Both :class:`SecurityHook` (the PreToolUse path) and :class:`ApprovalQueue`
(the decision-persistence path) write tool arguments into
``security_audit_log``. Those rows sit in plaintext SQLite and are returned
verbatim by ``/api/security/audit``, so a raw secret in the args (e.g.
``{"api_key": "sk-live-..."}``) would leak at rest and over the wire.

This module is the single source of truth for masking sensitive values and
truncating the summary. Keeping one helper means the two write paths cannot
drift — previously the queue had its own *unmasked* copy (F252).
